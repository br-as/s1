										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a mobile developer, one of the most powerful tools you have is data. Leveraging game data in the right way provides an incredible opportunity to identify problems, optimize performance, provide value to players, and ultimately grow your businesses.<br />
In this post I’ll discuss the signals in your new installers’ first day performance which can help identify where you might be losing players in your game. I’ll also share a number of meaningful benchmarks from Google Play for you to better understand your game’s performance and identify opportunities for improvement.<br />
Average player retention for games on Google Play<br />
Retention is one of the key installs performance metrics, along with buyer conversion and average revenue per install. In many ways, retention is the primary metric, since if you can retain your new players, you can always figure out how to make money. If you can’t retain any players, you have no ability to make money.<br />
The retention equation itself is very simple, it’s the number of users active on a given retention day divided by the number of installs in your cohort. For top grossing free to download games on Google Play, the median day 2 retention is 38%. Exceeding 46% day 2 retention places your game in the top quartile, which means you would be doing better than 75% of titles in the top charts.</p>
<p>Day 2 retention rates (where day 2 is the day after the first player session)<br />
However, it’s also important to think about what this means. A Day 2 retention of 22% to 52% actually means that 48% to 78% of all users who play a game for the first time today won’t come back tomorrow. Considering all the time and effort you devote to building and promoting games, you should do everything you can to improve this.<br />
What to focus on to improve retention<br />
Many developers focus on metrics like the level players reached on their first day, or the tutorial checkpoint their users passed. However, such metrics are game specific and do not help you understand how you compare to your peers.<br />
One key metric compares ‘Day 1 minutes played’ to the ‘Day 2 retention’. This metric, D1 minutes played vs. D2 retention, is much more of an apples to apples comparison, and is used at Google to help partners identify early deficiencies and increase their new installers’ performance.</p>
<p>Day 1 is the date of the first player session<br />
This graph shows the length of time a new player plays on their very first day, versus the percentage of users who return the next day. The trend shows that the longer people spend in a game on their first day, the more likely they are to return.<br />
This make instinctive sense. It’s reasonable to assume that the more time someone plays on their first day, they more they are enjoying themselves, and the greater the chance they’ll want to return to keep having fun.<br />
However, where it gets really interesting is when we split the top performing games into quartiles based on their Day 2 retention. The first quartile, the top performers, have an average Day 2 retention of 52%. Their retention starts off strong at about 22% and steadily rises with each successive minute played. The second quartile, comes in with a Day 2 retention of 42% average, and the third quartile has an average of 32% on Day 2.</p>
<p>We can see that most quartiles exhibit a very similar trend after the first 10 minutes; they all curve up and to the right with a steadily diminishing slope. However, it’s the first ten minutes where the most interesting patterns are visible.<br />
The first ten minutes is crucial<br />
This chart zooms into those first 10 minutes, and this is where we can see very distinct patterns emerge.</p>
<p>For the top performers (green line), their retention starts out strong and steadily rises. The second quartile (blue line) shows a different pattern, whereby we can see retention is largely flat across the first minute and a half, and only then does it begin to increase steadily. For the third quartile (orange), retention is predominantly flat until minute four, following which it then begins to increase but at a slower rate than higher performing apps. Finally in the fourth quartile (red line), retention actually declines in the first 2 minutes, and it isn’t until minute five that the games show a higher retention compared to those who played for less than a minute on their first day.<br />
Now, let’s take a look at how the early patterns impact our users. The chart below compares the cumulative players lost by minute for the top quartile (green line), versus the bottom quartile (red line).</p>
<p>The worst performers lose 46% of their new installs by the fifth minute. By the 10th minute, they’ve lost 58% of their new installs. Basically, over half their new installs don’t even last 10 minutes in the game. In contrast, top performers only lose 17% of players by the fifth minute, and only 24% by minute 10.<br />
The first 5 to 10 minutes are critical and they will make or break your day 2 retention.<br />
These top performing games have managed to retain over twice as many players as the lowest performing peers. There is however still a key question: if you could retain twice as many users on Day 2 and all following retention days, how would that help your daily active users (DAU)? How much would that improve your revenue? By leveraging Google Play data, we have identified two key patterns.<br />
Avoid the retention ‘flats’ and the ‘gorge’<br />
The first pattern is called the “Flats”. This anti-pattern shows largely flat retention for up to 10 minutes, with the percentages only rising meaningfully after the 5th to 10th minute. The second is the “Gorge”, whereby retention appears to drop minute by minute for the first five minutes or so, and then begins to rise again.</p>
<p>As a broad estimate, it’s likely that between 25% and 50% of games exhibit one of these anti-patterns. Leveraging the data in your own data warehouses, you can generate these plots and see what patterns emerge in your games. If you see the ‘Flats’ or the ‘Gorge’ in your own data, here’s a few things to examine:<br />
Does your game have a very large secondary download? This can cause players to quit if they are not on a good wireless connection.<br />
Are your tutorials fun? Do they give players a good sense of what the game is like?<br />
What are your loading times like? New players are especially susceptible to long loading times as they aren’t yet invested in the game.<br />
Does your lobby make instinctive sense to new players? Does someone coming out of the tutorial know how to get back into the action, how to build their base, and how to start having fun again? All of these considerations are important in ensuring users stick with your game.<br />
Are you running a large number of discount sales or offers on the first day? This tactic might earn some short term revenue at the expense of lower overall retention. Consider running tests which eliminate offers on the first day, but instead makes players feel rich to maximize their fun.<br />
A great benefit of optimizing the first 10 minutes of gameplay is that you can iterate quickly on experimental changes, and get results back from A/B tests in a couple days.<br />
Start an upwards trend in your player retention<br />
The first few minutes in a game are a critical time in a player’s life cycle. At this point, their only investment in your game has been the time and effort spent downloading it. Any negative experiences may lead players to quit, or switch to another game.<br />
If you find either “Flats” or “Gorge” anti-patterns in your game, or that your retention by minute starts out too low, then look even further to identify what might be causing it. Consider whether secondary downloads, long load times, or any other factors may be having a negative impact. If you can correlate adverse retention in the first 10 minutes to any particular factor, test changes to moderate or eliminate the cause, and you should see improvements in your game’s retention, daily active users, and ultimately revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>W<br />
hen you dream of the future, what do you see? Do you dream about concurrent odometry or horizontal plane detection? Do you fantasize about hot words and utterance capture? Probably not. Most likely, when you dream of the future, you imagine the places you can go, the things you can do, and the people you can be… just like you did when you were a kid.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Google Play approached IDEO to find out what emerging technologies like Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, digital assistant, and ephemeral apps (apps that you don’t have to download and install) may actually be good for. With the advent of these new technologies come infinite possibilities for their application. In this future, many things are possible, but what is useful and desirable? How will people integrate these technologies into their lives? When they think of what these technologies can do for them, what do they dream of? Where do they want to go? What do they imagine? Google was eager to find out.<br />
Since humans are at the center of IDEO’s design work, we started by talking to people and asking questions about their hopes for the future of these technologies.</p>
<p>We spoke to creators and stakeholders of these four technologies (experts, artists, and developers), as well as people ranging from elementary school kids to early adopters and technophobes. We held in-person conversations at IDEO San Francisco and got to know people over snacks and drinks. We had energetic and casual discussions — all to get inspired around the future.<br />
We intentionally didn’t discuss specific brands, platforms, or features. Instead, we created design exercises that abstracted each of the technologies into something you could hold, draw on, imagine, and experience.<br />
Here are highlights of what we heard:</p>
<p>Through these research sessions, we identified distinct promises each of these emerging technologies can uniquely offer:</p>
<p>When considering what these technologies are good for, how they can fit into your business, or how you can get started with them, it’s easy to just focus on their current capabilities or shortcomings and make assumptions about their actual value to people. Instead, we should think about what they mean for people by using these promises to guide our work.<br />
If we hope to create something of lasting value, we need to start with what people want — not just with what’s technically possible.<br />
What our research taught us about people’s hopes, wants, and dreams<br />
To get to what people are thinking and feeling, we need to get tangible and expressive. When you present people with a tangible concept that still offers room for input, they see potential and are open to sharing ideas. When you hand them something too polished, they look for flaws.<br />
Virtual Reality (VR)</p>
<p>“I wish I could share my experience with others, or maybe have a local friend show me around.” — Nikki<br />
The exercise: We handed people different scenes ranging from the mundane — like commuting on the subway, to the fantastical — like visiting Mars or flying over a city. We handed them out at random and asked them to imagine they were transported to this place. We also asked: how did you get here? What do you want to do here? Who would you like to have with you or communicate with?<br />
What people imagine: VR transports us to amazing new places. People want the freedom to explore those places on their own terms and to be able to share those experiences with others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The content in this post builds upon the discussion around venture capital funding and the investment process for mobile games businesses on Google’s Apps, Games, &#038; Insights podcast — tune in to the episode to learn more about maximizing investor appeal .<br />
Having spent almost 10 years at Google, my time there taught me that I was passionate about gaming and working with startups and investors. So it was a natural transition to the world of venture capital as I got to marry both these passions. Almost three years ago I joined London-based Initial Capital, focusing on gaming, media, and entertainment, and now at Cherry Ventures, I focus on seed-stage funding but across more verticals.<br />
Whether you are a startup in search of funding or an established business looking to accelerate your investment, venture capital can often be a good source of funds. In this blog post, I will share with you some insights into the venture capital process and how you might approach searching for venture capital for your business. I’ll also look at some trends in games that are of interest to venture capital firms.<br />
1. Determine what you want first<br />
Before looking for investment, it’s important to think carefully about your aspirations and the type of company you want to build. That way, you can find the right type of investor: not everyone will benefit from venture capital investment. When you take venture capital money you should expect investors to be very ambitious about what the company can achieve. If your level of ambition doesn’t match theirs you might find yourself in some difficult conversations. Also, when venture capital deploys big funds into a company they expect it to become a very big business. So, you need to know if that’s the way you want to take your business.<br />
For example, you want to build an indie game in an obscure category and what switches you on is winning industry awards and delighting a niche audience. These are valid reasons to build a business and can be the foundation of a very good business. However, that business is probably not bankable to a venture capitalist because it’s not going to grow to scale, no matter how successful you are.<br />
And chances are you don’t just need money. At the seed stage, businesses typically need expert advice to help with product market fit and building a business model. Therefore, you may want to find an investor that prioritizes providing advice over simply being a financial investor.<br />
2. Inside the venture-capital process<br />
At Cherry Ventures, we invest at the seed stage meaning we are typically the first institutional money a company raises. This can be when there is just an idea and a founding team. There is usually no product, but sometimes there might be a prototype. So, in addition to funding, we focus on helping the startup team, finding product market fit, and developing their business model.<br />
The next round of funding is Series A and Series B. After we invest, our focus is helping our founders effectively use their time and avoid mistakes commonly made by companies at this early stage. Through regular consultation and communication, we help companies identify — and avoid — possible obstacles to make their ride to success smoother.<br />
While our coaching keeps teams focused when things are going well, we also know building a business is tough and provide reassurance and assistance when some obstacles are unavoidable.<br />
3. Understand what investors look for<br />
Your product and team<br />
When looking to invest, particularly at the seed stage, investors will evaluate the product or service and team. The team is the most important element, but evaluating it can be difficult, mainly because it’s common to be a new team that has never started a company before. There are however patterns and signals that tell us whether a team is strong.<br />
Key attributes include the founder’s ability to articulate their vision and understanding of the milestones they need to achieve it. So, it helps to have a good idea, a good business plan, and a good thesis around the product as well — these things are more tangible and easier to evaluate.<br />
Adaptability<br />
Sometimes startups that look most likely to succeed fail very quickly, while ones that seemed more of a risk end up succeeding. The difference between these businesses is their ability to adapt. Teams that show they can relentlessly execute and change their narrative, adapting to circumstances are more likely to succeed.<br />
For startups, the most constrained resource is not money: it’s time, the time to convert and be flexible. So, while flexibility is an important indicator of success, there are not an infinite number of pivots available. Therefore, the ability to change quickly and correctly is married to flexibility. I haven’t seen many companies pivoting more than two or three times, because they run out of money before they could implement another change.<br />
4. Build and grow your startup<br />
So, how do you create a startup that is going to be of interest to venture capital investors?<br />
First, you need to be very clear about the problem you’re trying to solve. You can then prioritize the skill sets you need to have on board.<br />
Find ways to validate your theses efficiently: As it can take a long time to develop an app or game, one strategy worth considering is creating an ad for your proposed product to see how people respond. If the response is positive you might continue with iterations on the messaging to help understand what people are interested in. This can help to de-risk before you commit to significant engineering cycles.<br />
Fast release cycles and constant iteration: As long as it’s good enough for you to prove the core-mechanic, it’s useful to develop and release prototypes. And, it’s worth remembering that, if you launch something that feels really good and perfect, you have probably launched too late.<br />
Metrics reporting: It’s important to have good visibility on the metrics that matter to your business and product. Metrics are crucial and should be as specific as possible to your product and the experience you are building for your users so that you can decompose the drivers of that experience and what makes or breaks it. Being able to measure what you’re doing, and what works and what doesn’t, can then drive a process to improve iteratively. And, as I talked about earlier, the ability to adapt is key and strong metrics reporting will enable you to learn quickly, giving you more time and increase your chances of success.<br />
5. Find the right venture capital investor<br />
It’s important to think carefully about your aspirations and the type of company you want to build, so you can find the right type of investor: not everyone will benefit from venture capital investment. When venture capital investors deploy big funds into a company, they generally expect it to become a very big business. Therefore, you need to know if that’s the direction you want your business to take, before going down that route.<br />
You should do your research, check out investors through their website and review their portfolio. Look for contacts that you may have in companies in their portfolio, or reach out through your other contacts, and talk to them. Ask how they work with the investor, and what value do they get beyond the money? It’s also worth looking for events, virtual or otherwise, where venture capital companies may be pitching or scouting. For example, historically Slush is a good one for game developers.<br />
Start talking with investors as soon as possible, even if you don’t have a pitch, as it’s a good way to meet them. This is a relationship business: data matters and references matter, but ultimately not more than the relationship. Also, by talking to investors early, when you come to make your final pitch, there can already be a relationship to build on. Building a mutual understanding in advance goes a long way to achieving a successful investment.<br />
Also, chances are you don’t just need money. At the seed stage, businesses typically need expert advice to help with product market fit and business model. Therefore, you may also want to find an investor that prioritizes providing advice, over simply being a financial investor. More importantly, you should find an investor that has real experience, networks and knowledge that you can lean on. Venture Capitalists can help by opening their networks to you, so you should get a sense of how strong and complementary their network is.<br />
6. Share control with the investor<br />
Many people worry that bringing on board a venture capital investor means losing control of their company: they won’t, as long as they don’t give away too much equity. In fact, I would suggest that if a potential investor wants to take too much equity, especially at the beginning, it’s not a good signal. A good venture capital company will know that in order to achieve success the founders need to remain incentivized.<br />
But remember, there will be some level of sharing of the control. This is another reason why it’s important to be aligned with your investors and ensure you are all trying to achieve the same goals. There will definitely be differences of opinion, but again this is why relationships matter and a good relationship is the core foundation of a successful investment. Those differences can be healthy as long as the direction and ultimate goal is shared.<br />
7. Discover trends in mobile games<br />
One of the fascinating things that working in venture capital gives you is insight into trends in various industries.<br />
From a venture capital point of view, the most interesting games are the ones that have a good strategy for product development or user acquisition. More to the point, strategies that help them win where there is an oversupply of content compared to demand.<br />
From the product and content point of view, user-generated content (UGC) and mods-based content games, take an interesting approach to tackling this challenge.<br />
When it comes to user acquisition, a fascinating trend is enabling people that watch to interact with the people that play: engaging influencers and streamers inside the game.<br />
However, more broadly, when creating a mobile game you should think beyond the mobile games market. Consider the broader media and content market and how you can raise your product above the noise that is hitting people’s free time.<br />
Crossovers trends<br />
At Cherry Ventures we invested in a range of companies which opens up the possibility of applying learnings from one industry to another. Among these, we are seeing that consumer apps are learning how to build a product from games. For example, companies are adopting best practices to on-boarding, engaging, and monetizing users. You can see this in the approach taken by many wellness and fitness apps as an example.<br />
Although perhaps one of the big crossover trends at the moment is sustainability and how apps, games and their developers are becoming aware of social and environmental issues. It’s not just about the developer being more sustainable but also offering ways to empower people to help solve these issues. Looking for companies that embrace sustainability is very important to Cherry Ventures and, no doubt, the whole venture capital market. And, again, how you funnel that energy, how you can onboard and engage people around these missions, can learn a lot from games.<br />
Final words<br />
As an investor I enjoy being part of the team that helps startups through all their challenges, working through the highs and lows of building a business. I hope I have given you some useful pointers for figuring out whether venture capital is the right move for your company. If you do decide to go down that path, hopefully now you have some more information to guide you on your journey.</p>
